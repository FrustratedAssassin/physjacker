# Physjacker

A project I made for uni. Physjacker is an Electron app/js thing that's meant to provide a visualization of how pointless cryptocurrency mining is. Well, at least the CPU browser cryptojacking kind.

It uses matter.js for the physics simulation, and at the moment it uses my own CoinHive key so if you run it without that you'll make me (a tiny amount of) money.

# If this ever becomes an actual thing

It's gonna require:

* a better implementation of matter.js
  or rather, further customization
* implementing CoinHive the open-source thing and not the website that takes like 60% of your money
* probably adding a disclaimer that this thing will use all your CPU power and/or a way to select how much power to use
* definitely changing the default behaviour of it making _me_ money

I mean I'm probably not gonna work on it after tomorrow but hey if anyone wants to do something with this go ahead that's why it's on GitHub.
